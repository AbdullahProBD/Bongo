# Bongo for Windows

Native Avro phonetic Bengali input method for modern Windows desktops (Windows 10 and 11, x64 and ARM64).

Powered by a pure-Rust transliteration engine connected through a low-level keyboard hook background service, a modern dark-themed Settings application, and professional setup packages (.exe and .msi).

## Prerequisites for Building

* **Windows 10 / 11** (x64 or ARM64)
* **Python 3.10+** (with Tkinter included by default)
* **Rust toolchain** (`rustup default stable`)
* **Inno Setup 6** (for building `.exe` setup package)
* **WiX Toolset v3 / v4** (for building `.msi` package)

## Building from Source

From the project root on a Windows terminal:

```cmd
platforms\windows\scripts\build-windows.bat
```

This will:
1. Compile `bongo_engine.dll` using Cargo.
2. Compile standalone executables `bongo.exe` and `bongo-settings.exe` using PyInstaller.
3. Build the Inno Setup installer `platforms\windows\release\Bongo-Setup-1.0.0.exe`.
4. Build the WiX MSI installer `platforms\windows\release\Bongo-1.0.0-x64.msi`.
5. Generate SHA256 checksums for each release package.

## Developer Quick Start

To run Bongo directly without building installers:

```powershell
# Start the background typing service
python platforms\windows\service\bongo_service.py

# Or launch the Settings UI
python platforms\windows\ui\bongo_settings.py
```

Press `F12` to toggle Bangla typing on or off in any text field.
