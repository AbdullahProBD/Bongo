# Bongo - upstream attribution

Bongo is an independent derivative project, not an official release or endorsement
from OmicronLab, Abdur Rahim, or the OpenBangla team. The Bongo Phonetic product
label identifies Bongo's compatible presentation of the Avro Phonetic method; it
does not claim authorship of that method. Original source headers and licenses
remain in place.
